# Custom-RSA-Encrypting
This Project performs RSA Encryption and decryption with a customized BEARCAT encoding unlike ASCII

BEARCAT Encoding restricts the characters to the blank character and the upper case letters of the alphabet as follows: 
blank character is assigned the value 0.
A, …, Z are assigned the values 1, …, 26, respectively.
